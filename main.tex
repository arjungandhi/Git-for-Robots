\section{What is version control?}
\paragraph{}
    You can think of a version control system (short: "VCS\index{VCS}") as a kind of "database". It lets you save a snapshot of your complete project at any time you want. When you later take a look at an older snapshot (let's start calling it "version\index{version}"), your VCS shows you exactly how it differed from the previous one.

    Version control is independent of the kind of project / technology / framework you're working with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It works a website as it does for a robotics project
        \item It lets you work with any tool you like; it doesn't care what kind of text editor, graphics program, file manager or other tool you use
    \end{itemize}

    At the core of it a VCS records the changes you make to your project's files. This is what version control is about. It's really as simple as it sounds.
